<p>My name is Katie Beth Fowler. I am a freshman in the Honors Program at the University of Georgia. 
My hometown is Covington, GA which is about an hour away from Athens. 
Currently I am pursuing a degree in Public Relations with a minor in Classical Culture. 
I am also hoping to apply for the Double Dawgs program so I can obtain my bachelor and 
masters degree in five years. </p>
<p>One of my goals is to study abroad for a Maymester in my sophomore year, 
perhaps to China since there is a Maymester Public Relations program there. 
My junior year I would like to apply to the Disney College Program in my Spring semester. 
I have a passion for the Disney Company and would love to work there someday in their 
public relations department. </p>
<p>I am a member in the Redcoat marching band, in which I play the mellophone. 
I am also involved in Freshley which is a large ministry service on campus.
 Later this fall I plan to apply to become a service ambassador with Serve UGA 
 since I love serving the community around me and enjoy making an impact. </p>
 <p> An inspirational quote I like is:<br><q>It is better to light a candle than curse the darkness.</q> -Eleanor Roosevelt.
 This quote reminds me to not complain about my situation, but instead do something to fix it.</p>
